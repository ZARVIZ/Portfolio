My Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository serves as a live documentary of my journey into cybersecurity. It contains my project reports, CTF writeups, custom scripts, and notes as I build hands-on skills in penetration testing and ethical hacking.

I am currently pursuing my Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH v13) certification and hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science. My goal is to apply this knowledge to a practical, full-time role in the cybersecurity industry.
